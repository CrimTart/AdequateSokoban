# AdequateSokoban
A classic game recreated with Java. Made as a personal study project.

Control the player with arrow keys. Move all boxes on the bases to finish the level. You can push, but not  pull.

If you're stuck, press the R key to restart the level. Progress can be saved by pressing F5, then loaded with F8.

There are 60 levels in total. After you finish the last one, game restarts from the beginning.

Plans for the future(?): main menu, level selection.
