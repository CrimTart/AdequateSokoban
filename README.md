# AdequateSokoban
A classic game recreated with Java. Made as a personal study project.

Control the player with arrow keys. Move all boxes on the bases to finish the level. You can push, but not  pull.

If you're stuck, press the button to restart the level or undo up to 15 moves. Progress can be saved by pressing F5, then loaded with F9.

There are 60 levels in total. After you finish the last one, game restarts from the beginning.
